# Music Recommendation 

## Overview
The `Music_Recommendation.ipynp` script is designed to implement a music recommendation system using data from platforms like Spotify. The system utilizes sophisticated algorithms, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to analyze user preferences and listening habits. This README provides an overview of the script's functionality, key components, and usage instructions.

## Functionality
- **Data Analysis**: The script analyzes extensive datasets containing user interactions with music, such as listening history, favored tracks, skipped songs, and user-provided preferences like ratings or feedback.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: It employs collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to generate personalized music suggestions based on user profiles.
- **Real-time Data Fetching**: The script fetches real-time music data using the Spotify API, enabling the creation of innovative applications that integrate with the platform.

## Key Components
1. **Content-Based Recommendations**: The script generates recommendations based on music features like danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and tempo.
2. **Popularity Score Calculation**: It calculates the popularity score of input songs and derives a weighted popularity score based on release date.
3. **Hybrid Recommendations**: The script combines content-based and popularity-based recommendations to provide a diverse set of music suggestions tailored to user preferences.

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including Dash, pandas, and Spotipy.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the `music_recommendation.ipynb` script to initiate the music recommendation system.
3. **Interact with the System**: Use the provided Dash app to input a song name and select the recommendation type (content-based or hybrid) to receive personalized music recommendations.

## Dependencies
- Dash: For creating interactive web applications.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Spotipy: For interacting with the Spotify API.

## Conclusion
The `music_recommendation.ipynb` script offers a powerful tool for generating personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and music features. By leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time data fetching capabilities, the system enhances the music listening experience for users.
